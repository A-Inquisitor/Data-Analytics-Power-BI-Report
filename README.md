## Power BI Data Analysis 

Using Power BI to elevate the business intelligence practices of a medium-sized international retailer.

## Step 1: Importing Data into Power BI

- (Could use an Azure windows VM, but already have a windows product)
- Loading the data: 
    - Orders data
    - Products data
    - Stores data
    - Customers data
- Transforming the loaded data tables


## Step 2: Creating Necessary Analysis

- Date Time Analysis (through DAX formulas) also known as time intelligence functions
- Create a measures table to put all the measures in
    - **This is good practice** However I only utilised this half way through the project, *Learning point*
- Creating Date and Geography Hierarchies to perform granular analysis
- Creating **relationships** between correlating data tables

## Step 3: Report Pages 

Building Reports with interactive visuals
- Executive Summary Page
- Customer Detail Page
- Product Detail Page
- Stores Map Page


## Step 4: Cross-Filtering and Navigation

Making sure that all the visuals are correctly and relevantly linked to each other 

Creating a Navigation Bar to be able to navigate the Pages

## Step 5: Creating Metrics for Users Outside the Company using SQL

Ensuring that data insights can still be extracted and shared with a broader audience

Tools:
- **SQL** queries:
    - To disseminate key data without relying solely on visualisation platforms
